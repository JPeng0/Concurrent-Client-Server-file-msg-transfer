Multiple client - single server program

To run the program:

make clean
- resets database and cleans executables

make rserver
- runs the server

make lclient
- runs client in localhost

make r1

make r2

make r3

make rclient
-runs the client
- looks for a test script txt file 
- default is test.txt but can be easily changed in makefile

Again please have mercy
